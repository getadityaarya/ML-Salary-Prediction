# ML-Salary-Prediction
This project predicts employee salaries using regression models, evaluating performance with RMSE and R².

## 📁 Project Structure

- Assi1.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- model.py: Script version of the model pipeline for reproducibility.
- Salary Data.csv: Dataset with employee details including salary, education, experience, and industry.
- requirements.txt: List of Python packages required for the project.
- README.md: Project overview and usage instructions.

## 📊 Workflow

1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Handle missing or inconsistent data.
3. Perform feature engineering:
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., industry, education)
   - Creating new features if required
4. Apply multiple linear regression.
5. Evaluate model performance using:
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score

## 💡 Key Features

- Focus on practical use of regression in real-world business data.
- Comparison of metrics to assess model reliability.
- Clean code for both notebook and script-based workflows.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started
